`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage

- Clone a .env-example file

Clone in the project root with the following contents:

```
BASE_URL=https://example.com
OUTPUT_DIR=output
ZIP_FILE=archive.zip
```

- Run the Extraction Scripts

    - Extract HTML:

    `python extract-html.py --output-dir <output-directory>`

    - Extract CSS:

    `python extract-css.py --output-dir <output-directory>`

    - Extract Inline CSS:

    `python extract-inline-css.py --output-file <output-file>`

    - Extract JavaScript:

    `python extract-js.py --output-dir <output-directory>`

    - Extract Inline JavaScript:

    `python extract-inline-js.py --output-file <output-file>`

Replace <output-directory> with the desired directory for CSS and JavaScript files and <output-file> with the desired file names for inline CSS and JavaScript.

- Compress the Files:

After extracting the files, run the compression script to create a ZIP archive:

`python compress-files.py --output-dir <output-directory> --zip-file <zip-file-name>`

Replace <output-directory> with the directory where the extracted files are located and <zip-file-name> with the desired name for the ZIP archive.
